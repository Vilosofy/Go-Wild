          <p>
            "Alpacas, gentle South American camelids, are prized for their soft
            fleece in various colors. Standing around three feet tall and
            weighing 100-175 pounds, they're known for their calm nature and
            serve a cultural role in the Andes."

            "Alpacas boast a few unique traits and behaviors. They're known for
            their highly social nature, often forming close-knit herds. These
            animals are efficient grazers, utilizing their padded feet to tread
            lightly on terrain and eat without damaging grass roots.
            Additionally, alpacas have a curious habit of humming, using various
            vocalizations for communication among themselves."

            <h2>Fiber Production</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            Alpacas are primarily bred for their luxurious fleece, which is softer than wool and comes in various natural colors, including shades of white, brown, black, and gray. Their fiber is highly prized for its warmth, softness, and hypoallergenic qualities.
